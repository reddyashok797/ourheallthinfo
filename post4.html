<p>What is ADHD?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health condition that can cause unusual levels of hyperactivity and impulsive behaviors. People with ADHD may also have trouble focusing their attention on a single task or sitting still for long periods of time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many people experience inattention and changes in energy levels. For a person with ADHD, this happens more often and to a greater extent compared with people who don’t have the condition. It can have a significant effect on their studies, work, and home life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both adults and children can have ADHD. It’s a diagnosis recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/difference-between-add-and-adhd">Learn about types of ADHD and symptoms in both children and adults.</a></p>

<h2><a>Types of ADHD</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make ADHD diagnoses more consistent, the APA has grouped the condition into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three categories</a>, or types. These types are predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactivity-impulsive, and a combination of both.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Predominantly inattentive</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the name suggests, people with this type of ADHD have extreme difficulty focusing, finishing tasks, and following instructions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experts also think that many children with the inattentive type of ADHD may not receive a proper diagnosis because they don’t tend to disrupt the classroom.&nbsp;<a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-02707-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResearchTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;suggests this is more common among girls with ADHD.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People with this type of ADHD primarily show hyperactive and impulsive behavior. This can include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>fidgeting</li><li>interrupting people while they’re talking</li><li>not being able to wait their turn</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although inattention is less of a concern with this type of ADHD, people with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD may still find it difficult to focus on tasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Combined hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive type</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the most common type of ADHD. People with this combined type of ADHD display both inattentive and hyperactive symptoms. These include an inability to pay attention, a tendency toward impulsiveness, and above-average levels of activity and energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The type of ADHD you or your child has will determine how it’s treated. The type you have can change over time, so your treatment may change, too.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/three-types-adhd">Learn more about the three types of ADHD.</a></p>

<h2><a>What causes ADHD?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite how common ADHD is, doctors and researchers still aren’t sure what causes the condition. It’s believed to have neurological origins. Genetics may also play a role.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4074363/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResearchTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;suggests that a reduction in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/adhd-dopamine">dopamine is a factor in ADHD</a>. Dopamine is a chemical in the brain that helps move signals from one nerve to another. It plays a role in triggering emotional responses and movements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26748338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">researchTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;suggests a structural difference in the brain. Findings indicate that people with ADHD have less gray matter volume. Gray matter includes the brain areas that help with:</p>

<ul><li>speech</li><li>self-control</li><li>decision making</li><li>muscle control</li></ul>

<h2><a>ADHD diagnosis and testing</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s no single test that can tell if you or your child has ADHD. A&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2616166" target="_blank">2017 studyTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;highlighted the benefits of a new test to diagnose adult ADHD, but many clinicians believe an ADHD diagnosis can’t be made based on one test.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make a diagnosis, a doctor will assess any symptoms you or your child has had over the previous 6 months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your doctor will likely gather information from teachers or family members and may use checklists and rating scales to review symptoms. They’ll also do a physical exam to check for other health problems.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/rating-scale">Learn more about ADHD rating scales and what they can and cannot do.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you suspect that you or your child has ADHD, talk with a doctor about getting an evaluation. For your child, you can also talk with their school counselor. Schools regularly assess children for conditions that may be affecting their educational performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the assessment, provide your doctor or counselor with notes and observations about you or your child’s behavior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If they suspect ADHD, they may refer you or your child to an ADHD specialist. Depending on the diagnosis, they may also suggest making an appointment with a psychiatrist or neurologist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a>ADHD treatment</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Treatment for ADHD typically includes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/behavioral-therapy-for-adhd">behavioral therapies</a>, medication, or both.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Types of therapy include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a>, or talk therapy. With talk therapy, you or your child will discuss how ADHD affects your life and ways to help you manage it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another therapy type is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/behavioral-therapy">behavioral therapy</a>. This therapy can help you or your child learn how to monitor and manage your behavior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/medication-list">Medication</a>&nbsp;can also be very helpful when you’re living with ADHD. ADHD medications are designed to affect brain chemicals in a way that enables you to better control your impulses and actions.</p>

<h3>ADHD medication</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two main types of medications used to treat ADHD are stimulants and nonstimulants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants are the most commonly prescribed ADHD medications. These drugs work by increasing the amounts of the brain chemicals&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dopamine-effects">dopamine</a>&nbsp;and norepinephrine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Examples of these drugs include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">methylphenidate (Ritalin)</a>&nbsp;and amphetamine-based stimulants (<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adderall</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If stimulants don’t work well or cause troublesome side effects for you or your child, your doctor may suggest a nonstimulant medication. Certain nonstimulant medications work by increasing levels of norepinephrine in the brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These medications include atomoxetine (Strattera) and some antidepressants such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/bupropion-oral-tablet">bupropion (Wellbutrin)</a>.</p>

<h3>Natural remedies for ADHD</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to — or instead of — medication, several remedies have been suggested to help improve ADHD symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
