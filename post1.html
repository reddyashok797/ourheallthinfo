<h2><a>Who gets heart disease?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source</a>. In the United States, 1 in every 4 deaths in is the result of a heart disease. That’s about 610,000 people who die from the condition each year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heart disease doesn’t discriminate. It’s the leading cause of death for several populations, including white people, Hispanics, and Black people. Almost half of Americans are at risk for heart disease, and the numbers are rising.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-is-heart-disease-on-the-rise">Learn more about the increase in heart disease rates.</a></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While heart disease can be deadly, it’s also preventable in most people. By adopting healthy lifestyle habits early, you can potentially live longer with a healthier heart.</p>

<h2><a>What are the symptoms of heart disease in women?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Women often experience different signs and symptoms of heart disease than men, specifically with regards to CAD and other cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, a&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.0000097116.29625.7C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2003 study</a>&nbsp;looked at the symptoms most often seen in women who’d experienced a heart attack. The top symptoms didn’t include “classic” heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and tingling. Instead, the study reported that women were more likely to say they experienced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-symptoms">anxiety</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/symptom/difficulty-sleeping">sleep disturbances</a>, and unusual or unexplained fatigue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s more, 80 percent of the women in the study reported experiencing these symptoms for at least one month before their heart attack occurred.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Symptoms of heart disease in women can also be confused with other conditions, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/symptoms">depression</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/menopause/symptoms-signs">menopause</a>, and anxiety.</p>

<h2><a>What causes heart disease?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heart disease is a collection of diseases and conditions that cause cardiovascular problems. Each type of heart disease is caused by something entirely unique to that condition. Atherosclerosis and CAD result from plaque buildup in the arteries. Other causes of heart disease are described below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>Arrhythmia causes</h3>

<p>Causes of an abnormal heart rhythm include:</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Congenital heart defect causes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This heart disease occurs while a baby is still developing in the womb. Some heart defects may be serious and diagnosed and treated early. Some may also go undiagnosed for many years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/heart">heart’s structure</a>&nbsp;can also change as you age. This can create a heart defect that may lead to complications and problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Cardiomyopathy causes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several types of cardiomyopathy exist. Each type is the result of a separate condition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Dilated cardiomyopathy.</strong>&nbsp;It’s unclear what causes this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Dilated-Cardiomyopathy_UCM_444187_Article.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most commonTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;type of cardiomyopathy, which leads to a weakened heart. It may be the result of previous damage to the heart, such as the kind caused by drugs, infections, and heart attack. It may also be an inherited condition or the result of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fluctuating-blood-pressure">uncontrolled blood pressure</a>.</li><li><strong>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.&nbsp;</strong>This type of heart disease leads to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy">thicker heart muscle</a>. It’s usually inherited.</li><li><strong>Restrictive cardiomyopathy.</strong>&nbsp;It’s often unclear what leads to this type of cardiomyopathy, which results in rigid heart walls. Possible causes may include scar tissue buildup and a type of abnormal protein buildup known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/amyloidosis">amyloidosis</a>.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Heart infection causes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bacteria, parasites, and viruses are the most common causes of heart infections. Uncontrolled infections in the body can also harm the heart if they’re not properly treated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What are some risk factors for heart disease?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many risk factors for heart disease. Some are controllable, and others aren’t. The CDC says that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around 47 percentTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;of Americans have at least one risk factor for heart disease. Some of these risk factors include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension">high blood pressure</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-cholesterol">high cholesterol</a>&nbsp;and low levels of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol">high-density lipoprotein (HDL)</a>, the “good” cholesterol</li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/smoking/effects-on-body">smoking</a></li><li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/obesity">obesity</a></li><li>physical inactivity</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smoking, for example, is a controllable risk factor. People who smoke double their risk of developing heart disease, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-problems/heart-disease-stroke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)Trusted Source</a></p>
