<p>Overview</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone experiences occasional aches and pains. In fact, sudden pain is an important reaction of the nervous system that helps alert you to possible injury. When an injury occurs, pain signals travel from the injured area up your spinal cord and to your brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pain will usually become less severe as the injury heals. However, chronic pain is different from typical pain. With chronic pain, your body continues to send pain signals to your brain, even after an injury heals. This can last several weeks to years. Chronic pain can limit your mobility and reduce your flexibility, strength, and endurance. This may make it challenging to get through daily tasks and activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chronic pain is defined as pain that lasts at least 12 weeks. The pain may feel sharp or dull, causing a burning or aching sensation in the affected areas. It may be steady or intermittent, coming and going without any apparent reason. Chronic pain can occur in nearly any part of your body. The pain can feel different in the various affected areas.</p>

<h2><a>What causes chronic pain?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chronic pain is usually caused by an initial injury, such as a back sprain or pulled muscle. It’s believed that chronic pain develops after nerves become damaged. The nerve damage makes pain more intense and long lasting. In these cases, treating the underlying injury may not resolve the chronic pain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In some cases, however, people experience chronic pain without any prior injury. The exact causes of chronic pain without injury aren’t well understood. The pain may sometimes result from an underlying health condition, such as:</p>

<h2><a>Dealing with chronic pain</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There isn’t a cure for chronic pain, but the condition can be managed successfully. It’s important to stick to your pain management plan to help relieve symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Physical pain is related to emotional pain, so chronic pain can increase your stress levels. Building emotional skills can help you cope with any stress related to your condition. Here are some steps you can take to reduce stress:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Take good care of your body:</strong>&nbsp;Eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly can keep your body healthy and reduce feelings of stress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Continue taking part in your daily activities:</strong>&nbsp;You can boost your mood and decrease stress by participating in activities you enjoy and socializing with friends. Chronic pain may make it challenging to perform certain tasks. But isolating yourself can give you a more negative outlook on your condition and increase your sensitivity to pain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Seek support:</strong>&nbsp;Friends, family, and support groups can lend you a helping hand and offer comfort during difficult times. Whether you’re having trouble with daily tasks or you’re simply in need of an emotional boost, a close friend or loved one can provide the support you need.</p>
