<p>High cholesterol is a pretty common issue in the U.S. In fact, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/facts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source</a>, nearly 94 million U.S. adults ages 20 or older have what could be considered borderline high cholesterol.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, because this condition can often present without any real symptoms, you may not even know you have it until you visit your doctor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re wondering what causes high cholesterol, what to do if you’ve been diagnosed with it, and if there are ways to reverse it (hint: there are), read on for all the answers.</p>

<h2><a>What is cholesterol?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cholesterol is a type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/is-cholesterol-a-lipid">lipid</a>. It’s a waxy, fat-like substance that your liver produces naturally. It’s vital for the formation of cell membranes, certain hormones, and vitamin D.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cholesterol doesn’t dissolve in water, so it can’t travel through your blood on its own. To help transport cholesterol, your liver produces lipoproteins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lipoproteins are particles made from fat and protein. They carry cholesterol and triglycerides, another type of lipid, through your bloodstream. The two major forms of lipoprotein are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LDL cholesterol is any cholesterol carried by low-density lipoproteins. If your blood contains too much LDL cholesterol, you may be diagnosed with high cholesterol. Without treatment, high cholesterol may lead to many health issues, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-attack">heart attack</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stroke">stroke</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High cholesterol rarely causes symptoms in the beginning. That’s why it’s important to get your cholesterol levels checked on a regular basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>High cholesterol symptoms</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In most cases, high cholesterol is a “silent” condition. It typically doesn’t cause any symptoms. Many people don’t even realize they have high cholesterol until they develop serious complications, such as a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s why routine cholesterol screening is important. If you’re 20 years or older, ask your doctor if you should have routine cholesterol screening.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-cholesterol-symptoms#overview1">Learn how this screening could potentially save your life.</a></p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Causes of high cholesterol</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eating too many foods that are high in cholesterol, saturated fats, and trans fats may increase your risk of developing high cholesterol. Living with obesity can also increase your risk. Other lifestyle factors that can contribute to high cholesterol include inactivity and smoking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your genetics can also affect your chances of developing high cholesterol. Genes are passed down from parents to children. Certain genes instruct your body on how to process cholesterol and fats. If your parents have high cholesterol, you may be at a greater risk of having it too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In rare cases, high cholesterol is caused by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/familial-hypercholesterolemia">familial hypercholesterolemia</a>. This genetic disorder prevents your body from removing LDL. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genome.gov/25520184/learning-about-familial-hypercholesterolemia/#al-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Human Genome Research InstituteTrusted Source</a>, most adults with this condition have total cholesterol levels above 300 milligrams per deciliter and LDL levels above 200 milligrams per deciliter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other health conditions, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-cholesterol/treating-with-statins/guide-to-diabetes-and-high-cholesterol">diabetes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/thyroid-issues-and-cholesterol">hypothyroidism</a>, may also increase your risk of developing high cholesterol and related complications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>LDL cholesterol, or “bad cholesterol”</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/ldl-cholesterol">LDL cholesterol</a>&nbsp;is often called “bad cholesterol.” It carries cholesterol to your arteries. If your levels of LDL cholesterol are too high, it can build up on the walls of your arteries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This buildup is also known as cholesterol plaque. This plaque can narrow your arteries, limit your blood flow, and raise your risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-tell-if-you-have-a-blood-clot">blood clots</a>. If a blood clot blocks an artery in your heart or brain, it can cause a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>HDL cholesterol, or “good cholesterol”</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cholesterol/hdl-cholesterol">HDL cholesterol</a>&nbsp;is sometimes called “good cholesterol.” It helps return LDL cholesterol to your liver to be removed from your body. This helps prevent cholesterol plaque from building up in your arteries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you have healthy levels of HDL cholesterol, it can help lower your risk of blood clots, heart disease, and stroke.</p>

<h2><a>Triglycerides, a different type of lipid</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/triglycerides">Triglycerides</a>&nbsp;are another type of lipid. They’re different from cholesterol. While your body uses cholesterol to build cells and certain hormones, it uses triglycerides as a source of energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you eat more calories than your body can use right away, it converts those calories into triglycerides. It stores triglycerides in your fat cells. It also uses lipoproteins to circulate triglycerides through your bloodstream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you regularly eat more calories than your body can use, your triglyceride levels may become too high. This can raise your risk of several health problems, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hypertensive-heart-disease">heart disease</a>&nbsp;and stroke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your doctor can use a simple blood test to measure your triglyceride level, as well as your cholesterol levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Getting your cholesterol levels checked</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re 20 years or older, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Cholesterol/HowToGetYourCholesterolTested/How-To-Get-Your-Cholesterol-Tested_UCM_305595_Article.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Heart AssociationTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;recommends getting your cholesterol levels checked at least once every 4 to 6 years. If you have a history of high cholesterol or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, your doctor may encourage you to get your cholesterol levels tested more often.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your doctor can use a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cholesterol-test">lipid panel</a>&nbsp;to measure your total cholesterol level, as well your LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Your total cholesterol level is the overall amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes LDL and HDL cholesterol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your levels of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol are too high, your doctor may diagnose you with high cholesterol. High cholesterol can be dangerous when your LDL levels are too high and your HDL levels are too low.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being diagnosed with high cholesterol doesn’t automatically mean you will be put on medication. If your doctor does prescribe you medication, different factors may influence the type of medication they recommend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this in mind, most physicians use generalized measurements to decide on treatment plans. They may categorize these measurements as desirable, borderline high, or high cholesterol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/cholesterol-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Library of Medicine</a>, the total cholesterol of most adults can be categorized as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table -->
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><th scope="col">Total cholesterol</th><th scope="col">Category</th></tr><tr><td>less than 200 mg/dL</td><td>desirable</td></tr><tr><td>200-239 mg/dL</td><td>borderline high</td></tr><tr><td>240 mg/dL and above</td><td>high</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/cholesterol-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Library of Medicine</a>&nbsp;also provides optimal to high categories of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:table -->
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><th scope="col">LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels</th><th scope="col">Category</th></tr><tr><td>less than 100 mg/dL</td><td>optimal</td></tr><tr><td>100-129 mg/dL</td><td>near optimal</td></tr><tr><td>130-159 mg/dL</td><td>borderline high</td></tr><tr><td>160-189 mg/dL</td><td>high</td></tr><tr><td>190 mg/dL and above</td><td>very high</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, these measurements are general. You and your doctor will consider other personal factors before deciding on a treatment plan.</p>

<h2><a>Recent guidelines for healthy cholesterol levels</a></h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your body needs some cholesterol to function properly, including some LDL. But if your LDL levels are too high, it can raise your risk of serious health problems.</p>
