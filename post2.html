<h2><a>STIs vs. STDs</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often confused, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/sti-vs-std">aren’t actually the same thing</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An infection —<strong></strong>which is when bacteria, viruses, or parasites attack the body —<strong></strong>comes before a disease.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while an infection&nbsp;<a href="https://publichealth.tulane.edu/blog/sti-vs-std/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may result in zero symptoms</a>, a disease usually always comes with clear signs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Think of it this way: An STD will always start out as an STI. But not all STIs turn into STDs.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you know the difference between the two, here’s the lowdown on the types of STDs that currently exist, how to treat them, and, most importantly, how to prevent them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>STD symptoms</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If an STD starts with a symptomatic STI, you might first experience:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>pain or discomfort during sexual activity or urination</li><li>sores, bumps, or rashes on or around the vagina, penis, testicles, anus, buttocks, thighs, or mouth</li><li>unusual discharge or bleeding from the penis or vagina</li><li>painful or swollen testicles</li><li>itchiness in or around the vagina</li><li>unexpected periods or bleeding after sexual activity</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But remember that not all STIs have symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If an STI progresses to an STD, symptoms can vary. Some of them may be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar to the above</a>, such as pain during sexual activity, pain during urination, and irregular or painful periods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But other symptoms can be quite different and depend on the STD. They can include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>fever</li><li>recurring pain</li><li>fatigue</li><li>memory loss</li><li>changes to vision or hearing</li><li>nausea</li><li><a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/symptoms-of-hiv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight loss</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/understanding-your-diagnosis/signs-and-symptoms-of-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lumps or swellingsTrusted Source</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Underlying STD causes</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All STDs are caused by an STI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These infections are usually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/general/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transmitted through sexual contactTrusted Source</a>, including through bodily fluids or skin contact via vaginal, oral, and anal sex.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of them never become a disease, especially if they’re treated, and they can even go away on their own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if the pathogens that caused the infection end up damaging cells in the body and disrupting its functions, an STI&nbsp;<a href="https://publichealth.tulane.edu/blog/sti-vs-std/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will progress to an STD</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Types of STDs</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the list of STIs is pretty lengthy, there are fewer STDs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They range from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid">pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</a>, caused by STIs like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/std/chlamydia">chlamydia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gonorrhea">gonorrhea</a>, to some forms of cancer, caused by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/human-papillomavirus-infection">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Below are the main STDs to be aware of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Pelvic inflammatory disease</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/trichomoniasis">trichomoniasis</a>&nbsp;are common STIs that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/pid/stdfact-pid.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can lead to PIDTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;if left untreated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not all cases of PID are caused by an STI</a>, as other bacterial infections can play a role.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/pid/stdfact-pid-detailed.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.5 million womenTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;in the United States have a reported lifetime history of being diagnosed with PID, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although this infection of the female reproductive organs is classified as a disease, some people have no symptoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who do have symptoms may experience:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>pelvic or lower abdominal pain</li><li>pain during penetrative vaginal sex or when urinating</li><li>irregular, heavy, or painful vaginal bleeding</li><li>unusual vaginal discharge</li><li>nausea</li><li>high temperature</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antibiotics can successfully treat PID if it’s diagnosed early enough. However, they won’t treat any scarring on the fallopian tubes that may have occurred.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This scarring can make an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/ectopic-pregnancy">ectopic pregnancy</a>&nbsp;more likely and has also been linked to infertility, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around 1 in 10</a>&nbsp;people with PID becoming infertile as a result.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Tertiary syphilis</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The early stages of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/std/syphilis">syphilis</a>&nbsp;—<strong></strong>a relatively uncommon infection — are considered an STI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The infection first appears as one or more small round sores on the genitals, anus, or mouth. If left untreated, syphilis will move to the latent phase, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has no symptomsTrusted</a></p>
